ShopEasy – Flutter E-Commerce Demo App

ShopEasy is a simple Flutter application developed to demonstrate UI development, state management, and clean project structure using Flutter. The app simulates a basic e-commerce experience where users can browse products, add items to a cart, and view profile information.

This project focuses on clarity, maintainability, and best practices suitable for beginner to intermediate Flutter development.
